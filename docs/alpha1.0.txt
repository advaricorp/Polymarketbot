# Alpha 1.5 Summary

## Current Status âœ…
1. **Frontend**
   - React app is running and accessible at `http://3.65.249.159/polybot`
   - Base routing with `/polybot` prefix is working correctly
   - Main dashboard page loads successfully
   - React Router is configured correctly with `basename="/polybot"`
   - Dark theme is implemented with Material-UI

2. **Backend**
   - API service is running on port 8001
   - Health check endpoint is configured

## Next Steps ðŸš€

1. **Frontend Priorities**
   - Verify all API integrations are working
   - Test all navigation routes (Markets, Settings, etc.)
   - Implement error handling for API calls
   - Add loading states for data fetching
   - Complete the Markets detail view

2. **Backend Tasks**
   - Verify all API endpoints are responding correctly
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add logging for debugging
   - Set up proper environment configuration

3. **DevOps/Infrastructure**
   - Set up process management (PM2 or systemd) for both frontend and backend
   - Configure proper logging
   - Set up monitoring
   - Implement backup strategy

4. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Test all features end-to-end
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create deployment documentation
   - Add setup instructions

Would you like me to help you tackle any of these next steps? We can start with setting up process management to ensure your services stay running, or we can focus on testing the API integrations.
