# Alpha 1.5 Summary

## Current Status âœ…
1. **Backend**
   - API service is running on port 8001
   - Health check endpoint is configured
   - Virtual environment (venv) is set up with required dependencies
   - Market data service is initialized and running
   - API endpoints for markets are configured

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - `.env` file is set up with Polymarket API credentials
   - API host, key, secret, and passphrase are configured
   - API endpoints for WebSocket and REST are defined
   - Logging configuration is in place

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/health` - Health check endpoint
   - `/markets` - Get all markets
   - `/markets/{condition_id}` - Get a specific market
   - `/markets/refresh` - Force a refresh of market data

4. **Market Data Service**
   - Successfully fetches markets from Polymarket API
   - Updates market state with order book data
   - Tracks market conditions, token IDs, and pricing information
   - Provides clean interfaces for other services to access market data

5. **Authentication**
   - Polymarket client is initialized with API credentials
   - Authentication headers are properly set for API requests
   - API key, secret, and passphrase are used for L2 authentication

## What We've Fixed ðŸ”§
1. **Client Initialization**
   - Fixed the issue with client initialization by ensuring proper environment variables
   - Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

2. **Market Data Updates**
   - Fixed the issue with market updates by using token IDs instead of condition IDs
   - Added proper error handling for market data fetching
   - Implemented proper pagination for fetching markets

3. **API Server**
   - Fixed the issue with the API server not running by ensuring proper environment setup
   - Added proper logging for debugging
   - Implemented proper error handling for API endpoints

## What We're Still Working On ðŸš§
1. **Private Key Authentication**
   - Need to set up the `POLY_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable for L1 authentication
   - Need to implement proper key generation and management

2. **Error Handling**
   - Need to improve error handling for API requests
   - Need to implement proper retry mechanisms for failed requests

3. **Testing**
   - Need to implement comprehensive testing for all components
   - Need to set up proper test environment

## Next Steps ðŸš€
1. **Set Up Private Key Authentication**
   - Generate a private key for L1 authentication
   - Update the `.env` file with the private key
   - Test the authentication with the private key

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Implement proper retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - Add more detailed error logging
   - Implement proper error responses for API endpoints

3. **Testing**
   - Set up a proper test environment
   - Implement comprehensive testing for all components
   - Test the API endpoints with real data

4. **Documentation**
   - Document the API endpoints
   - Document the environment variables
   - Document the authentication process

## Conclusion
We've made significant progress in setting up the Polymarket Bot API. The basic infrastructure is in place, and we've fixed several issues with the client initialization and market data updates. We're still working on setting up the private key authentication and improving error handling, but the foundation is solid.
